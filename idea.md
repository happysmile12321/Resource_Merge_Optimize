## compile

  Some times we want our computer to code at idea,but not run on local computer.
  
  So this may need us to connect a remote computer to get code run there and bring back result as we want.
  
  As we all know,our code run an linux,so we might want a script to help local idea to bring code on this linux machine,,,
  
  So,Let's get started!!!
  
  *ODL remote debug*
  
  Mouse move to <Right . Up> click the Class We want to compile,enter,chose Edit configuration.
  
  <Left . Up> click add button,chose remote.
  
  enter your linux ip and port,done it.
  
  > test
  
  ```
  
  ```
